# Leetcode Challenges

Welcome to my personal repository for coding challenges from **Leetcode**! This repository is part of my journey to improve my problem-solving skills and revisit the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. Iâ€™ll be solving these challenges using **Python** and **JavaScript**, with a focus on completing the 150 recommended questions.

## About

As a software engineer with significant experience in cloud, infrastructure, and software architecture, I realized I needed to return to the basics and refine my understanding of algorithms and system design. This repository serves as a public log of my progress and a resource for others following a similar path.

## Folder Structure

Each coding challenge is organized into its own folder, which contains:

- A markdown file (`problem.md`) with the problem description.
- Two files, one for the Python solution and one for the JavaScript solution.
