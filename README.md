# Leetcode Challenges

Welcome to my personal repository for coding challenges from **Leetcode**! This repository is part of my journey to improve my problem-solving skills and revisit the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. I’ll be solving these challenges using **Python** and **JavaScript**, with a focus on completing the 150 recommended questions.

## About

As a software engineer with significant experience in cloud, infrastructure, and software architecture, I realized I needed to return to the basics and refine my understanding of algorithms and system design. This repository serves as a public log of my progress and a resource for others following a similar path.

## Folder Structure

Each coding challenge is organized into its own folder, which contains:

- A markdown file (`problem.md`) with the problem description.
- Two files, one for the Python solution and one for the JavaScript solution.
  .
  ├── Two_Sum
  │ ├── python.py
  │ ├── js.js
  │ └── problem.md
  ├── Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters
  │ ├── python.py
  │ ├── js.js
  │ └── problem.md
  ├── Merge_Intervals
  │ ├── python.py
  │ ├── js.js
  │ └── problem.md
  └── README.md

### Explanation:

- **Two_Sum**, **Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters**, etc.: Each folder is named after the problem being solved, with underscores instead of spaces.
  - `python.py`: The Python solution for the problem.
  - `js.js`: The JavaScript solution for the problem.
  - `problem.md`: The problem description, including constraints and examples.

## Languages

I will be solving the challenges using:

- **Python**: Known for its simplicity and readability.
- **JavaScript**: Widely used for both frontend and backend development.

## Challenges

Each problem folder contains:

1. **Problem description**: Available in `problem.md`.
2. **Solution in Python**: Located in `python.py`.
3. **Solution in JavaScript**: Located in `js.js`.
4. **Time complexity and space complexity**: Included in the code comments of each solution.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-challenges.git
   cd leetcode-challenges
   ```

2. **Browse the problem folders**: Each folder is named after the problem being solved.

3. **Run Python solutions**:

   ```bash
   python3 path/to/problem_folder/python.py
   ```

4. **Run JavaScript solutions**:
   ```bash
   node path/to/problem_folder/js.js
   ```
